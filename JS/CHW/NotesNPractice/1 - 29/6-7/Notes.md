# explain bitwise operator in short

- Bitwise operators in JavaScript perform operations on binary representations of integers at the bit level. They operate on the bits of numbers, treating them as sequences of bits rather than their numeric values. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the primary bitwise operators:

1. Bitwise AND (&)
   Compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number whose bits are set to 1 only if both corresponding bits of the operands are 1.

- let a = 5; // Binary: 0101
  let b = 3; // Binary: 0011
  let result = a & b; // Binary: 0001 (1 in decimal)

2. Bitwise OR (|)
   Compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number whose bits are set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1.

- let result = a | b; // Binary: 0111 (7 in decimal)

3. Bitwise XOR (^)
   Compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number whose bits are set to 1 only if the corresponding bits of the operands are different.

- let result = a ^ b; // Binary: 0110 (6 in decimal)

4. Bitwise NOT (~)
   Inverts the bits of a number, changing 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s. The result is also a negative number because it represents the two's complement.

- let result = ~a; // Inverts bits: ~0101 becomes 1010, which is -6 in decimal

5. Left Shift (<<)
   Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions. This effectively multiplies the number by 2 for each shift.

- let result = a << 1; // Binary: 1010 (10 in decimal)

6. Right Shift (>>)
   Shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions. This effectively divides the number by 2 for each shift, preserving the sign.

- let result = a >> 1; // Binary: 0010 (2 in decimal)

7. Unsigned Right Shift (>>>)
   Shifts the bits of a number to the right without preserving the sign. This means that 0s are filled in from the left, regardless of the original sign of the number.

- let result = -5 >>> 1; // Results in a large positive number due to zero-filling

* Summary
  Bitwise operators are useful for low-level programming tasks, such as manipulating binary data, performing bitwise calculations, or optimizing certain operations. They operate on the bit level, making them powerful tools for performance-critical applications, although they can be less readable than regular arithmetic operations.

- Bitwise operators in JavaScript perform operations directly on the binary representations of integers, manipulating individual bits of the numbers. They include:

AND (&): Returns a new number with bits set to 1 where both operands have 1s.
OR (|): Returns a new number with bits set to 1 where at least one operand has 1.
XOR (^): Returns a new number with bits set to 1 where the operands differ.
NOT (~): Inverts the bits of a number, turning 0s to 1s and vice versa.
Left Shift (<<): Shifts bits to the left, effectively multiplying by 2 for each shift.
Right Shift (>>): Shifts bits to the right, dividing by 2 while preserving the sign.
Unsigned Right Shift (>>>): Shifts bits to the right, filling with 0s, regardless of the sign.
These operators are useful for low-level programming tasks and bit manipulation.
