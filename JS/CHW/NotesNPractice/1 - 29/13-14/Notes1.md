# define property and methods explicitly (related to properties or methods of strings)

In JavaScript:

Properties
Definition: Properties are attributes or characteristics of an object that hold data.

Usage: Accessed directly, properties provide information or state about the object without performing any actions.

Example: .length is a property of strings that tells you the number of characters in the string.

let text = "Hello";
console.log(text.length); // Output: 5

Methods
Definition: Methods are functions associated with an object that perform actions or operations using the object’s data.

Usage: Methods are invoked with parentheses () and often manipulate the object’s data or return some result based on it.

Example: .toUpperCase() is a string method that converts all characters in the string to uppercase.

let text = "Hello";
console.log(text.toUpperCase()); // Output: "HELLO"

In short: Properties provide data about an object, while methods perform actions on or with that data.
