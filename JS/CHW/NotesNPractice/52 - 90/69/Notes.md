No, data in localStorage is not sent to the server automatically. It is stored locally on the user's device within their browser, and only accessible via client-side JavaScript.

However, if you want to send localStorage data to the server, you would need to do so manually, usually by making a network request (like an XMLHttpRequest or fetch call) and including the data in the request payload.

For example:

# code

// Get data from localStorage
const token = localStorage.getItem("authToken");

// Send data to the server
fetch("https://example.com/api", {
method: "POST",
headers: {
"Content-Type": "application/json"
},
body: JSON.stringify({ token: token })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));

In this way, the data can be shared with the server, but it requires explicit action to do so.
