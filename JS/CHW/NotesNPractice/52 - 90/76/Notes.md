In JavaScript, this within a method refers to the object on which the method was called. When you use this.name = givenName;, youâ€™re creating or updating the name property of that specific object with the value of givenName.

class Person {
fill(givenName) {
this.name = givenName;
}
}

const person1 = new Person();
person1.fill("Alice");

console.log(person1.name); // "Alice"

In this case, this.name becomes a property of person1, holding the value "Alice". Each object created from Person can have its own unique name property, as this refers to the instance calling fill().
