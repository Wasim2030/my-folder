# A function that does something asynchronously should provide a callback argument where we put a function to run after asynchronous action.

Yes, that's correct! When a function performs an asynchronous operation, it should accept a callback as an argument. This callback function is then executed once the asynchronous action completes, allowing you to handle the result or any errors.

Basic Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example of a function that uses a callback to handle asynchronous behavior:

# code

function fetchData(callback) {
// Simulating an asynchronous operation using setTimeout
setTimeout(() => {
const data = "Fetched data";
callback(null, data); // Call the callback with the result
}, 1000);
}

// Using the callback to handle the result
fetchData((error, data) => {
if (error) {
console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
} else {
console.log("Data:", data); // Logs "Data: Fetched data" after 1 second
}
});

How It Works
Callback as an Argument: fetchData accepts callback as a parameter, which is a function.
Asynchronous Operation: setTimeout simulates a delay (representing an asynchronous task).
Executing the Callback: After the delay, callback(null, data) is called with the result, making data accessible in the callback function.
Benefits
Control Flow: Using callbacks helps manage the flow of asynchronous operations.
Error Handling: You can pass both error and success results, allowing better error handling within the callback.
This pattern is common in JavaScript, although promises and async/await are now often preferred for more complex asynchronous code, as they improve readability and error handling.
